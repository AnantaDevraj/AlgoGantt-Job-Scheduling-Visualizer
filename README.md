# 🚀 AlgoGantt – Job Scheduling Visualizer

**AlgoGantt** is a web-based visualizer for simulating and comparing classic **Operating System job scheduling algorithms** like **FCFS**, **SJF**, **Round Robin**, and more.

This project helps students and developers understand how different scheduling algorithms perform using **real-time visualizations**, **interactive Gantt charts**, and **performance metrics**.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔄 Select scheduling algorithm from a dropdown
- 🧾 Add custom processes (Arrival Time, Burst Time)
- 📊 Visualize scheduling in a Gantt chart
- ⚡ Compare efficiency between algorithms
- ✅ Intuitive, clean UI with TailwindCSS
- 💻 Backend logic implemented in C++

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Custom Gantt components (HTML/CSS) and Chart.js (planned)
- **Algorithms**: Written in **Javascript**, to be integrated via backend or WebAssembly

---

## 📅 Completed Milestones

- ✅ Day 1: Project setup, Navbar with dropdown, FCFS form UI
- 🔜 Day 2: FCFS scheduling logic + Gantt chart visualization
